# Texter

A network application utilizing the internet protocol to have one connected device A
use the texting facilities (sms) of another connected device B. Additionally, each 
device A should be able to manage the text messages on device B (list, remove).

This project is still experimental: use at your own risk!

P.S. we still need to establish user license.
